# Google-Ads-Campaign-Analytics-SQL-PROJECT

SQL-based end-to-end analysis of simulated Google Ads data ‚Äî profiling, cleaning, anomaly detection, and multi-level performance insights with business recommendations.

## 1. Project Background & Overview  
This project simulates the role of a data analyst working with Google Ads campaign data for a **Data Analytics Course**.  
The dataset represents ad performance metrics (*impressions, clicks, conversions, costs, sales*) across **campaigns, locations, devices, and keywords**.  

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nayakganesh007/google-ads-sales-dataset).

The goal was to treat this dataset as if it were delivered by a business stakeholder and apply professional data analytics practices:  
- Profiling  
- Cleaning  
- Anomaly detection  
- Performance analysis  

The following are the key areas for gathering insights as they directly influence marketing ROI and business decision-making:  
- **Campaign Performance** ‚Üí Identify which campaigns drive the most revenue & conversions.  
- **Location Effectiveness** ‚Üí Highlight high-ROI geographies for budget allocation.  
- **Device Insights** ‚Üí Assess Desktop vs. Mobile vs. Tablet efficiency to guide optimization.  
- **Keyword Analysis** ‚Üí Evaluate which keywords bring the most qualified traffic.  
- **Time Trends** ‚Üí Detect daily performance patterns & opportunities for scheduling/promotions.

## 4. Executive Summary  

In November 2024, simulated Google Ads data for the Data Analytics Course campaigns was analyzed across 2,600 ad records. Overall portfolio performance was strong, delivering a Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) of 6.85, with more than 345K clicks generated from 11.5M impressions at an average CTR of 3.0%. 
The Beginners and Certification campaigns emerged as the top revenue drivers (‚Çπ750K each), while Advanced and Training ‚Äì Online contributed slightly lower returns. At the city level, Gurgaon outperformed all markets with ROAS 7.07, followed by Bengaluru (6.83) and Mumbai (6.83), whereas Hyderabad lagged at 6.67 despite high volume. Device analysis revealed Desktop conversions (4.83%) slightly outpaced Mobile (4.77%) and Tablet (4.69%), with cost efficiency stable across both. Keyword-level insights highlighted ‚ÄúOnline Data Analytics‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn Data Analytics‚Äù as the top-performing drivers, each exceeding 2,800 conversions at ~3% CTR. Finally, time trend analysis showed revenue peaks on Nov 14 and Nov 25, aligning with likely campaign pushes, while dips on Nov 6, 11 and Nov 17 suggest delivery or targeting inefficiencies.

**Key takeaways:**  
- Campaigns are profitable overall (ROAS 6.85).  
- Beginners & Certification = key revenue drivers.  
- Gurgaon = most efficient market.  
- Desktop slightly outperforms Mobile and Tablet.
